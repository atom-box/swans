Small experiments that don't deserve their own repository until they get bigger.

## Table of Contents
* *imageChanger.html*  A pixel manipulator to investigate the bitmap image format.  Features: show the original bmp file, accept user input to show a manipulated bitmap, show the hex code file of before and after, explain the header and file structure of a bitmap, investigate typing hex and using javascript to manipulate hex.  Helpful side effect: it is familiarizing me with the Hex editor of Beyond Compare! 
* _pixelConstructor.js_ Eventually this will generate a bitmap ab initio.  For now I am writing imageChanger.html instead as I come to grips with building a bitmap by hand from just hex numbers.  
## Shout out to
Harvard CS50, which let me build a C language image enlarger.  I would never attempt this otherwise!!
