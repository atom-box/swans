* *imageChanger.html*  A pixel manipulator to investigate the bitmap image format.  Features: show the original bmp file, accept user input to show a manipulated bitmap, show the hex code file of before and after, explain the header and file structure of a bitmap, investigate typing hex and using javascript to manipulate hex.  Helpful side effect: it is familiarizing me with the Hex editor of Beyond Compare!
